# MovieQuiz
Studying how to code and create choice quiz in JavaScript 

I have studied through the tutorial of YouTube ("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYIMygIcU"), as well explored via the sources of GitHub 
("https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Multiple-Choice-Quiz-JavaScript"). But I have created the pics of movies and questions by myself.
